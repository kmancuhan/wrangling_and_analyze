# Project: Data Wrangling and Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a template for the data wrangling procedure, using multiple sources of data. Here, data wrangling means necessary steps to clean the data. The objective also includes providing a basic analysis from the data to answer some of the questions, after completing the cleaning procedure:

  1.  Would rating, retweet and likes (favorites) change according to the age of the dogs in
  the tweets?
  2. How does the image classification performance for tweets with images change, with
  respect to the source of the tweet?
  3. Which class labels are confused most for misclassified images?
  4. Are there a relationship, or correlation, between favorite and retweet counts of tweets? Do people like the tweets they retweet, especially for WeRateDogs?

Here, WeRateDogs is a Twitter page giving ratings for various dog tweets. We use the tweet list of this page, giving more details in the subsequent parts of this README.

## Description

The template consists of three parts: data gathering, assessing the issues, and cleaning. Cleaning part has a set of issues, each of which has the definition, coding and testing subsections.
